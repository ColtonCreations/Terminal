# Terminal
Terminal for Arduino and CoolTerm, Fallout 3 inspired
See notes in sketch for more. BE CAREFUL with taking apart an old microwave, it can literally KILL you in more ways than one if you don't know what you're doing. 
I mean, ensure capacitors are discharged, don't fool around with the transformer 
(Industry Canada has literally warned agains fracking art using these, people have been maimed or died)
and the beryllium inside the magnetron is toxic if it's broken open so just dont.
Ok, now that that's out of the way, I used a servo and a cobbled together linkage to open the microwave after the correct password is entered.
This this works pretty well, if you're looking to improve on it, it still can be forced to freak out and basically crash if you mash the
keyboard enough but used generally as intended, works really well.
